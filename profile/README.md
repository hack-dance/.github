# Hack.Dance
We're a software studio focused on building novel ways to deliver intelligent experiences. We are a small team and have worked with companies like OpenAI, NBA, Red Bull, Live Nation, Moms First, BloomTech, and others we can't talk about. We're particularly interested in breaking away from from traditional interfaces and creating something new.

We open source tools we build along the way and work with the community to push things forward. If you're building something interesting, we'd love to chat.
